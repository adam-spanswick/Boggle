1. To use this program run the GUIManager class, there are no command line arguments. Once the program runs
   click either the 4x4 Game or 5x5 Game buttons to start a new game. Then click on the letters you want to
   play and when you have a word click check word an dif it is valid it will be added to the guessed word list
   and the score will be update or click reset word button and it will clear the tray and you can start over.
   If you want to reset the game click reset game button and you can start a new game.

2. There are no testing or debugging tools.

3. I did the entire program.

4. I have 3 main issues/bugs:
   1. Not every time ,but sometimes, when the program starts and you click either 4x4 Game or
      5x5 Game the program freezes and must be exited manually. I spent hours trying to figure
      out the cause but I could not narrow it down.  **If you encounter this bug keep rerun the game it will work!**
   2. When clicking on letter tiles while playing you can click on non-adjacent tiles and play
      a word and it will count it.
   3. The timer only displays the time in seconds but it does work when the game ends and keeps
      track of the time correctly. I could just not figure out how to display minutes and seconds
      not just seconds.
